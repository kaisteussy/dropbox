# dropbox
Dropbox OAuth flows and basic file operations.

This repository contains a python script, dropbox_oauth_json.py, that uses the Dropbox SDK to execute an OAuth flow for the sake of retreiving an access token. That access token can then be used to interface with the corresponding Dropbox app folder or user account.
